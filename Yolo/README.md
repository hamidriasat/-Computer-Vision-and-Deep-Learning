# YOLO: Real Time Object Detection and Recognition

## Tiny [YOLO](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640) V1 for single class detection implementation in python.

You Only Look Once (YOLO) is a fast object detection algorithm. In YOLO a single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full image. And itâ€™s optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance. I implemented YOLO from scratch in PyTorch.
