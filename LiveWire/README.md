# Implementation of the Livewire: Interactive Segmentation Tool

## [LiveWire](http://www.cb.uu.se/~filip/ImageProcessingUsingGraphs/Projects/OmerIshaq.pdf) implementation in python.

Livewire is a segmentation technique which allows a user to select regions of interest to be extracted quickly and accurately, using simple mouse clicks. I implemented it in python.
